## MongoDB Access
- MongoDB access has been granted to all team members.
- If you do not have access, please send your email ID via direct message.

---

## Environment Variables
- The `.env.local` file has been shared in the common group. Ensure you add it to the root directories of the `client` and `server` folders.

---

## Important Notes
1. **Frontend API Endpoints**:
   - The frontend currently uses APIs hosted on Render.
   - Use the `search and replace` functionality in your editor to replace all API URLs with the `localhost` URL once the server is running.
   - The `localhost` URL will be available after you start the backend server.

2. **Model Folder**:
   - Currently, no work is required on the `model` folder.
